# BlueArchive: Rendezvous

## Liscense

&ensp;&ensp;  This repository contains two independent projects, [CoreFramework](https://github.com/xueyufengling/BlueArchive-Rendezvous/tree/main/src/main/java/fw) and [BlueArchive-Rendezvous](https://github.com/xueyufengling/BlueArchive-Rendezvous/tree/main/src/main/java/ba), which are published in the same repository for convenience. CoreFramework is a general framework library for mod development, and its source code is released under the [LGPL-v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html.en) license. BlueArchive-Rendezvous is the actual content source code of the mod, and its source code is released under the [PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/) license. All "this project" mentioned below refers to this project. The copyright of all the [related assets](https://github.com/xueyufengling/BlueArchive-Rendezvous/tree/main/src/main/resources/assets/ba/textures) used in this mod and extracted from the game belongs to the copyright holder of [Blue Archive](https://bluearchive.nexon.com).<br>

### Precautions

&ensp;  This is **NOT** a [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) project, anyone **CANNOT** use this mod for any commercial purposes, including but not limited to:<br>
a. Sell this mod or its modified versions' binary files, source code.<br>
b. Paid technical support and consulting services for this mod or its modified versions.<br>
c. Set up a server with this mod as the main function and charge players.<br>
more situation can be inferred from [liscense terms](LICENSE-BlueArchive-Rendezvous.txt).<br>

### Why use PolyForm Noncommercial License?

&ensp;&ensp;  First of all, our purpose in creating this mod is to allow everyone to play and experience the Minecraft-style BlueArchive for free and immersively.<br> 
&ensp;&ensp;  Legally speaking, game manufacturers own the copyrights of the characters, plot settings, etc. of the games they designed. Fan creation and publishing actually infringes on their rights. But now, most game manufacturers tacitly allow non-profit fan creation. As mod developers, we will release the binary files of the mod for free, but we also have to find a way to prevent others from using this mod for any form of profit, which is why this mod uses a strongly restrictive license.<br> 
&ensp;&ensp;  Existing open-source licenses all explicitly allow commercial use. Although these licenses may force the disclosure of source code, they cannot prevent users from using the binary files of these source codes for sale or providing services for profit, which runs counter to our original intention. [CC-NC License](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/) explicitly prohibits the use of works for any form of commercial purposes, but it is not a license designed for software, and there is no clear definition of matters such as the distribution and modification of source code, and the Creative Commons organization does not recommend it as a software license. At this point, adopting a "Source Code Available License" becomes the only option that allows free distribution and modification of the mod and its source code and prohibits commercial use for commercial purposes.<br>

## Statement

    Due to the particularity of the mod project, we cannot avoid using in-game assets. Since the copyright holder has clearly stated that it does not support the unpacking of game assets, we will be ready to delete any related assets files used in the mod and stop maintaining the project. When using in-game assets, we will ensure the following points: <br>

1. Do not disclose any unpacked original assets resources and unpacking methods. <br>

2. Do not use or disclose any assets, plot settings, or other commercial secrets that have not been disclosed to the public by the copyright holder. <br>

3. Do not make any form of profit and prevent others from making profits through licensing. <br>

    In addition, the code of this mod mainly relies on [Lyra](https://github.com/xueyufengling/Lyra) and [CoreFramework](https://github.com/xueyufengling/BlueArchive-Rendezvous/tree/main/src/main/java/fw) for implementation. These libraries do not involve specific mod logic and are only introduced as utilities for mod development. The source code is fully owned by the developer and distributed in accordance with relevant licenses. It will not be deleted due to any external factors.<br>

    The copyright of all components of the mod, including source code, maps, buildings, models, etc., belongs to the relevant contributors themselves. For details, please see the list of contributors below.<br>
